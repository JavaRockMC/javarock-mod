# JavaRock Mod

## About
This is a mod for the JavaRock Minecraft server with the purpose of being able to interface with the JavaRock discord bot as well as the JavaRock website. There are also plans to be able to add events and stuff later on as well.

### Currently, none of this stuff works so don't expect it to
## Compiling
The mod automatically compiles itself in the GitHub actions tab but in case that isn't working you can compile it yourself.

You can compile the mod just like you compile any other Fabric mod but in case you don't know how to do that:
1. Clone this GitHub repository and open it in your terminal of choice
2. Run `gradlew build`

It's that easy. If the build fails first make sure you're running Java 16.
